# JuliaLearning

Welcome to **JuliaLearning**, a repository documenting my journey in mastering the Julia programming language. This project serves as a collection of my experiments, projects, and notes as I explore Julia's capabilities for numerical computing, data science, and beyond.

## Goals

- Develop a strong foundation in Julia programming.
- Explore Juliaâ€™s applications in:
  - High-performance numerical computing.
  - Data analysis and visualization.
  - Machine learning and optimization.
- Create a portfolio of projects demonstrating practical applications of Julia.

## Why Julia?

I'm interested in its computational efficiency, but my learning process is primarily motivated by GSoC '25. Hope to be there!

## Get Started

1. Install Julia from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JuliaLearning.git
   ```
3. Explore the contents and follow along with the learning journey.

## Contributions

This repository is personal and non-collaborative for now. However, suggestions, feedback, and resource recommendations are always welcome!
